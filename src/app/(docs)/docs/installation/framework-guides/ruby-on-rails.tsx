        The quickest way to start using Tailwind CSS in your Rails project is to use{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails">Tailwind CSS for Rails</a> by running{" "}
        <code>rails new my-project --css tailwind</code>. This will automatically configure your Tailwind setup based on
        the official Rails example. If you'd like to configure Tailwind manually, continue with the rest of this guide.
