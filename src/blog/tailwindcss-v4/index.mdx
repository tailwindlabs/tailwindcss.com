## New high-performance engine

Tailwind CSS v4.0 is a ground-up rewrite of the framework, taking everything we've learned about the architecture over the years and optimizing it to be as fast as possible.

When benchmarking it on our own projects, we've found full rebuilds to be over 3.5x faster, and incremental builds to be over 8x faster.

Here are the median build times we saw when we benchmarked Tailwind CSS v4.0 against [Catalyst](https://tailwindui.com/templates/catalyst):

{

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>v3.4</th>
      <th>v4.0</th>
      <th>Improvement</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Full build</td>
      <td>378ms</td>
      <td>100ms</td>
      <td>3.78x</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Incremental rebuild with new CSS</td>
      <td>44ms</td>
      <td>5ms</td>
      <td>8.8x</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Incremental rebuild with no new CSS</td>
      <td>35ms</td>
      <td>192µs</td>
      <td>182x</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
}

The most impressive improvement is on incremental builds that don't actually need to compile any new CSS — these builds are over 100x faster and complete in _microseconds_. And the longer you work on a project, the more of these builds you run into because you're just using classes you've already used before, like `flex`, `col-span-2`, or `font-bold`.

---

## Designed for the modern web

The platform has evolved a lot since we released Tailwind CSS v3.0, and v4.0 takes full advantage of many of these improvements.

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

@layer utilities {
  .mx-6 {
    margin-inline: calc(var(--spacing) * 6);
  }
  .bg-blue-500\/50 {
    background-color: color-mix(in oklab, var(--color-blue-500) 50%, transparent);
  }
}

@property --tw-gradient-from {
  syntax: "<color>";
  inherits: false;
  initial-value: #0000;
}
```

We're leveraging modern CSS features like:

- **Native cascade layers** — giving us more control than ever over how different style rules interact with each other.
- **Registered custom properties** — making it possible to do things like animate gradients, and significantly improving performance on large pages.
- **color-mix()** — which lets us adjust the opacity of any color value, including CSS variables and `currentColor`.
- **Logical properties** — simplifying RTL support and reducing the size of your generated CSS.

Many of these features have even simplified Tailwind internally, reducing the surface area for bugs and making the framework easier for us to maintain.

---

## Simplified installation

We've streamlined the setup process a ton in v4.0, reducing the number of steps and removing a lot of boilerplate.

<CodeExampleStack>

```shell
# [!code filename:1. Install Tailwind CSS]
npm i tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss;
```

```js
// [!code filename:2. Add the PostCSS plugin]
export default {
  plugins: ["@tailwindcss/postcss"],
};
```

```css
/* [!code filename:3. Import Tailwind in your CSS] */
@import "tailwindcss";
```

</CodeExampleStack>

With the improvements we've made to this process for v4.0, Tailwind feels more light-weight than ever:

- **Just one-line of CSS** — no more `@tailwind` directives, just add `@import "tailwindcss"` and start building.
- **Zero configuration** — you can start using the framework without configuring anything, not even the paths to your template files.
- **No external plugins required** — we bundle `@import` rules for you out of the box, and use [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/) under the hood for vendor prefixing and modern syntax transforms.

Sure you only go through this once per project, but it adds up when you're starting and abandoning a different side-project every weekend.

## First-party Vite plugin

If you're a Vite user, you can now integrate Tailwind using [`@tailwindcss/vite`](/docs/installation/using-vite) instead of PostCSS:

```js
// [!code filename:vite.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
// [!code highlight:2]
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // [!code highlight:2]
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
});
```

Tailwind CSS v4.0 is incredibly fast when used as a PostCSS plugin, but you'll get even better performance using the Vite plugin.

## Automatic content detection

You know how you always had to configure that annoying `content` array in Tailwind CSS v3? In v4.0, we came up with a bunch of heuristics for detecting all of that stuff automatically so you don’t have to configure it at all.

For example, we automatically ignore anything in your `.gitignore` file to avoid scanning dependencies or generated files that aren’t under version control:

```shell
# [!code filename:.gitignore]
/node_modules
/coverage
/.next/
/build
```

We also automatically ignore all binary extensions like images, videos, .zip files, and more.

And if you ever need to explicitly add a source that's excluded by default, you can always add it with the `@source` directive, right in your CSS file:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@import "tailwindcss";
/* [!code highlight:2] */
@source "../node_modules/@my-company/ui-lib";
```

The `@source` directive uses the same heuristics under the hood, so it will exclude binary file types for example as well, without you having to specify all of the extensions to scan explicitly.

Learn more about in our new documentation on [detecting classes in source files](/docs/detecting-classes-in-source-files).

---

## Built-in import support

Before v4.0, if you wanted to inline other CSS files using `@import` you'd have to configure another plugin like `postcss-import` to handle it for you.

Now we handle this out of the box, so you don't need any other tools:

```js
//  [!code filename:postcss.config.js]
export default {
  plugins: [
    "postcss-import", // [!code --]
    "@tailwindcss/postcss",
  ],
};
```

Our import system is purpose-built for Tailwind CSS, so we've also been able to make it even faster by tightly integrating it with our engine.

---

## CSS-first configuration

One of the biggest changes in Tailwind CSS v4.0 is the shift from configuring your project in JavaScript to configuring it in CSS.

Instead of a `tailwind.config.js` file, you can configure all of your customizations directly in the CSS file where you import Tailwind, giving you one less file to worry about in your project:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --font-display: "Satoshi", "sans-serif";

  --breakpoint-3xl: 1920px;

  --color-avocado-100: oklch(0.99 0 0);
  --color-avocado-200: oklch(0.98 0.04 113.22);
  --color-avocado-300: oklch(0.94 0.11 115.03);
  --color-avocado-400: oklch(0.92 0.19 114.08);
  --color-avocado-500: oklch(0.84 0.18 117.33);
  --color-avocado-600: oklch(0.53 0.12 118.34);

  --ease-fluid: cubic-bezier(0.3, 0, 0, 1);
  --ease-snappy: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1);

  /* ... */
}
```

The new CSS-first configuration lets you do just about everything you could do in your `tailwind.config.js` file, including configuring your design tokens, defining custom utilities and variants, and more.

To learn more about how it all works, read the new [theme variables](/docs/theme) documentation.

---

## CSS theme variables

Tailwind CSS v4.0 takes all of your design tokens and makes them available as CSS variables by default, so you can reference any value you need at run-time using just CSS.

Using the example `@theme` from earlier, all of these values will be added to your CSS to as regular custom properties:

```css
/* [!code filename:Generated CSS] */
:root {
  --font-display: "Satoshi", "sans-serif";

  --breakpoint-3xl: 1920px;

  --color-avocado-100: oklch(0.99 0 0);
  --color-avocado-200: oklch(0.98 0.04 113.22);
  --color-avocado-300: oklch(0.94 0.11 115.03);
  --color-avocado-400: oklch(0.92 0.19 114.08);
  --color-avocado-500: oklch(0.84 0.18 117.33);
  --color-avocado-600: oklch(0.53 0.12 118.34);

  --ease-fluid: cubic-bezier(0.3, 0, 0, 1);
  --ease-snappy: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1);

  /* ... */
}
```

This makes it easy to reuse these values as inline styles or pass them to libraries like [Motion](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#css-variables) to animate them.

---

## Dynamic utility values and variants

We've simplified the way many utilities and variants work in v4.0 by effectively allowing them to accept certain types of arbitrary values, _without_ the need for any configuration or dropping down to the arbitrary value syntax.

For example, in Tailwind CSS v4.0 you can create grids of any size out of the box:

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<!-- [!code classes:grid-cols-15] -->
<div class="grid grid-cols-15">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

You can also target custom boolean data attributes without needing to define them:

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<!-- [!code classes:data-current:opacity-100] -->
<div data-current class="opacity-75 data-current:opacity-100">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

Even spacing utilities like `px-*`, `mt-*`, `w-*`, `h-*`, and more are now dynamically derived from a single spacing scale variable and accept any value out of the box:

```css
/* [!code filename:Generated CSS] */
@layer theme {
  :root {
    --spacing: 0.25rem;
  }
}

@layer utilities {
  .mt-8 {
    margin-top: calc(var(--spacing) * 8);
  }
  .w-17 {
    width: calc(var(--spacing) * 17);
  }
  .pr-29 {
    padding-right: calc(var(--spacing) * 29);
  }
}
```

The upgrade tool we released alongside v4.0 will even simplify most of these utilities for you automatically if it notices you using an arbitrary value that's no longer needed.

---

## Modernized P3 color palette

We've upgraded the entire default color palette from `rgb` to `oklch`, taking advantage of the wider gamut to make the colors more vivid in places where we were previously limited by the sRGB color space.

<div className="not-prose my-12">
  <ColorPalette />
</div>

We've tried to keep the balance between all the colors the same as it was in v3, so even though we've refreshed things across the board, it shouldn't feel like a breaking change when upgrading your existing projects.

---

## Container queries

We've brought container query support into core for v4.0, so you don't need the `@tailwindcss/container-queries` plugin anymore:

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<!-- [!code classes:@container,@sm:grid-cols-3,@lg:grid-cols-4] -->
<div class="@container">
  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 @sm:grid-cols-3 @lg:grid-cols-4">
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
</div>
```

We've also added support for max-width container queries using the new `@max-*` variant:

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<!-- [!code classes:@container,@max-md:grid-cols-1] -->
<div class="@container">
  <div class="grid grid-cols-3 @max-md:grid-cols-1">
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
</div>
```

Like our regular breakpoint variants, you can also stack `@min-*` and `@max-*` variants to define container query ranges:

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<!-- [!code classes:@container,@min-md:@max-xl:hidden] -->
<div class="@container">
  <div class="flex @min-md:@max-xl:hidden">
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
</div>
```

Learn more in our all-new [container queries](/docs/responsive-design#container-queries) documentation.

## New 3D transform utilities

We've finally added APIs for doing 3D transforms, like `rotate-x-*`, `rotate-y-*`, `scale-z-*`, `translate-z-*`, and tons more.

<Figure>

<Example>
  {
    <div className="grid perspective-distant">
      <article className="relative isolate z-10 flex w-full max-w-80 rotate-x-51 rotate-z-43 flex-col justify-end justify-self-center overflow-hidden rounded-2xl bg-gray-900 px-8 pt-80 pb-8 shadow-xl transition-all duration-500 transform-3d">

## Expanded gradient APIs

We've added a ton of new gradient features in v4.0, so you can pull off even fancier effects without having to write any custom CSS.

### Linear gradient angles

Linear gradients now support angles as values, so you can use utilities like `bg-linear-45` to create a gradient on a 45 degree angle:

<Figure>

<Example>
  {
    <div className="grid place-items-center">
      <div className="size-32 rounded-lg bg-linear-45 from-indigo-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500"></div>
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:bg-linear-45] -->
<div class="bg-linear-45 from-indigo-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500"></div>
```

</Figure>

You may notice we've renamed `bg-gradient-*` to `bg-linear-*` too — you'll see why shortly!

### Gradient interpolation modifiers

We've added the ability to control the color interpolation mode for gradients using a modifier, so a class like `bg-linear-to-r/srgb` interpolates using sRGB, and `bg-linear-to-r/oklch` interpolates using OKLCH:

<Figure>

<Example>
  {
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4">
      <div className="h-16 rounded-lg bg-linear-to-r/srgb from-indigo-500 to-teal-400"></div>
      <div className="h-16 rounded-lg bg-linear-to-r/oklch from-indigo-500 to-teal-400"></div>
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:bg-linear-to-r/srgb,bg-linear-to-r/oklch] -->
<div class="bg-linear-to-r/srgb from-indigo-500 to-teal-400">...</div>
<div class="bg-linear-to-r/oklch from-indigo-500 to-teal-400">...</div>
```

</Figure>

Using polar color spaces like OKLCH or HSL can lead to much more vivid gradients when the `from-*` and `to-*` colors are far apart on the color wheel. We're using OKLAB by default in v4.0 but you can always interpolate using a different color space by adding one of these modifiers.

### Conic and radial gradients

We've added new `bg-conic-*` and `bg-radial-*` utilities for creating conic and radial gradients:

<Figure>

<Example>
  {
    <div className="flex justify-around p-8">
      <div className="size-24 rounded-full bg-conic/[in_hsl_longer_hue] from-red-600 to-red-600"></div>
      <div className="size-24 rounded-full bg-radial-[at_25%_25%] from-white to-zinc-900 to-75%"></div>
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:bg-conic/[in_hsl_longer_hue],bg-radial-[at_25%_25%]] -->
<div class="size-24 rounded-full bg-conic/[in_hsl_longer_hue] from-red-600 to-red-600"></div>
<div class="size-24 rounded-full bg-radial-[at_25%_25%] from-white to-zinc-900 to-75%"></div>
```

</Figure>

These new utilities work alongside the existing `from-*`, `via-*`, and `to-*` utilities to let you create conic and radial gradients the same way you create linear gradients, and include modifiers for setting the color interpolation method and arbitrary value support for controlling details like the gradient position.

---

## @starting-style support

The new `starting` variant adds support for the new CSS [`@starting-style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style) feature, making it possible to transition element properties when an element is first displayed:

<Figure>

<Example className="flex py-0">
  {
    <Iframe className="h-[340px] w-full">
      <div className="grid h-full items-center justify-center">
        <button

```html
<!-- [!code classes:starting:open:opacity-0,transition-discrete] -->
<div>
  <button popovertarget="my-popover">Check for updates</button>
  <div popover id="my-popover" class="transition-discrete starting:open:opacity-0 ...">
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
</div>
```

</Figure>

With `@starting-style`, you can finally animate elements as they appear on the page without the need for any JavaScript at all. [Browser support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_at-rules_starting-style) probably isn't quite there yet for most teams, but we're getting close!

## not-\* variant

We've added a new `not-*` variant which finally adds support for the CSS `:not()` pseudo-class:

<CodeExampleStack>

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<!-- [!code classes:not-hover:opacity-75] -->
<div class="not-hover:opacity-75">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
.not-hover\:opacity-75:not(*:hover) {
  opacity: 75%;
}

@media not (hover: hover) {
  .not-hover\:opacity-75 {
    opacity: 75%;
  }
}
```

</CodeExampleStack>

It does double duty and also lets you negate media queries and `@supports` queries:

<CodeExampleStack>

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<!-- [!code classes:not-supports-hanging-punctuation:px-4] -->
<div class="not-supports-hanging-punctuation:px-4">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
.not-supports-hanging-punctuation\:px-4 {
  @supports not (hanging-punctuation: var(--tw)) {
    padding-inline: calc(var(--spacing) * 4);
  }
}
```

</CodeExampleStack>

## Even more new utilities and variants

We've added a ton of other new utilities and variants to v4.0 too, including:

- **New [`inset-shadow-*`](/docs/box-shadow#adding-an-inset-shadow) and [`inset-ring-*`](/docs/box-shadow#adding-an-inset-ring) utilities** — making it possible to stack up to four layers of box shadows on a single element.
- **New [`field-sizing`](/docs/field-sizing) utilities** — for auto-resizing textareas without writing a single line of JavaScript.
- **New [`color-scheme`](/docs/color-scheme) utilities** — so you can finally get rid of those ugly light scrollbars in dark mode.
- **New [`font-stretch`](/docs/font-stretch) utilities** — for carefully tweaking variable fonts that support different widths.
- **New [`inert`](/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#styling-inert-elements) variant** — for styling non-interactive elements marked with the `inert` attribute.
- **New [`nth-*`](/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#first-last-odd-and-even) variants** — for doing really clever things you'll eventually regret.
- **New [`in-*`](/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#implicit-groups) variant** — which is a lot like `group-*`, but without the need for the `group` class.
- **Support for [`:popover-open`](/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#openclosed-state)** — using the existing `open` variant to also target open popovers.
- **New [descendant variant](/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#styling-all-descendants)** — for styling all descendant elements, for better or for worse.

Check out the relevant documentation for all of these features to learn more.

**And that's it — that's Tailwind CSS v4.0.** It's been years of work to get to this point, but we're all extremely proud of this release and we can't wait to see what you build with it.

Check it out, play with it, maybe even break it, and definitely let us know what you think.

Just no bug reports until tomorrow please — let us at least enjoy one celebratory team dinner and maybe relax in the hot tub at this hotel for a bit believing that somehow we really did ship flawless software.
