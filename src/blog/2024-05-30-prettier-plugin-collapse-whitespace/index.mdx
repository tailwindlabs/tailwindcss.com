## Cleaning up unnecessary whitespace

When you're copying around class names or deleting a class name from the middle of a list, it's easy to end up with some extra whitespace that needs to be cleaned up.

Now our Prettier plugin will handle this for you automatically, so you don't need to clean it up yourself.

<div className="relative overflow-hidden rounded-2xl">
  <div className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-0 rounded-2xl ring-1 ring-slate-900/10 ring-inset"></div>
  <video
    src="https://assets.tailwindcss.com/blog/2024-05-30-prettier-plugin-collapse-whitespace/collapse-whitespace.mp4"
    autoPlay
    playsInline
    loop
    muted
    className="m-0 block"
  />
</div>

## Removing duplicate classes

Our [VS Code extension](/docs/editor-setup#intellisense-for-vs-code) has warned you about duplicate class names for a long time, but now our Prettier plugin can remove those duplicate classes for you automatically.

<div className="relative overflow-hidden rounded-2xl">
  <div className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-0 rounded-2xl ring-1 ring-slate-900/10 ring-inset"></div>
  <video
    src="https://assets.tailwindcss.com/blog/2024-05-30-prettier-plugin-collapse-whitespace/remove-duplicates.mp4"
    autoPlay
    playsInline
    loop
    muted
    className="m-0 block"
  />
</div>

To start playing with these improvements in your own projects, just install the latest version:

```sh
npm i prettier-plugin-tailwindcss@latest
