Today we are super excited to share that [Simon Vrachliotis](https://twitter.com/simonswiss) has joined the development team at Tailwind Labs! (We just finalized that new business name by the way, pretty cool right?)

Simon has been a utility-first true believer since before Tailwind even existed, and authored an oft-referenced case study on his experience [rebuilding his company’s entire website with functional CSS in 10 days](https://hackernoon.com/full-re-write-with-tachyons-and-functional-css-a-case-study-part-1-635ccb5fb00b) way back in February 2017.

He also created the [first-ever Tailwind CSS video course](https://egghead.io/courses/build-user-interfaces-by-composing-css-utility-classes-with-tailwind), published on egghead.io only 4 months after we released v0.1.0.

Steve and I met Simon for the first time when we visited Sydney for Laracon AU back in 2018, where Simon was giving a talk on, of course, utility-first CSS:

He knocked it out of the park, and it has been an absolute pleasure getting to know Simon better over the time since we first met.

Simon is a talented developer, an amazing teacher, and has such a contagious enthusiasm for the sort of work we do that we knew we had to have him on the team if we ever had the chance.

He’s joining in a product and community focused role, and will be doing lots of amazing work helping us build things like Tailwind UI, as well as creating educational resources to help even more people have success with Tailwind CSS.

We couldn’t be more excited to be welcoming him to the team!
