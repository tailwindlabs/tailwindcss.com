## Examples

### Basic example

Use `indent-<number>` utilities like `indent-2` and `indent-8` to set the amount of empty space (indentation) that's shown before text in a block:

<Figure>

<Example>
  {
    <p className="mx-auto max-w-sm indent-8 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
      So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my
      way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of
      all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
    </p>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:indent-8] -->
<p class="indent-8">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

</Figure>

### Using negative values

To use a negative text indent value, prefix the class name with a dash to convert it to a negative value:

<Figure>

<Example>
  {
    <p className="mx-auto max-w-sm -indent-8 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
      So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my
      way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of
      all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
    </p>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:-indent-8] -->
<p class="-indent-8">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

</Figure>

### Using a custom value

<UsingACustomValue element="p" utility="indent" name="text indentation" value="50%" variable="indentation" />

### Responsive design

<ResponsiveDesign element="p" property="text-indent" defaultClass="indent-4" featuredClass="indent-8" />
