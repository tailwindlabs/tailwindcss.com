## Examples

### Optimizing with will change

Use the `will-change-scroll`, `will-change-contents` and `will-change-transform` utilities to optimize an element that's expected to change in the near future by instructing the browser to prepare the necessary animation before it actually begins:

```html
<!-- [!code classes:will-change-scroll] -->
<div class="overflow-auto will-change-scroll">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

It's recommended that you apply these utilities just before an element changes, and then remove it shortly after it finishes using `will-change-auto`.

The `will-change` property is intended to be used as a last resort when dealing with **known performance problems**. Avoid using these utilities too much, or simply in anticipation of performance issues, as it could actually cause the page to be less performant.

### Using a custom value

<UsingACustomValue
  utility="will-change"
  name={
    <>
      <code>will-change</code> property
    </>
  }
  value="top,left"
  variable="properties"
/>
