## Overview

Built on top of [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize), Preflight is a set of base styles for Tailwind projects that are designed to smooth over cross-browser inconsistencies and make it easier for you to work within the constraints of your design system.

When you import `tailwindcss` into your project, Preflight is automatically injected into the `base` layer:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

@import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme);
/* [!code highlight:2] */
@import "tailwindcss/preflight.css" layer(base);
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities);
```

While most of the styles in Preflight are meant to go unnoticed—they simply make things behave more like you'd expect them to—some are more opinionated and can be surprising when you first encounter them.

For a complete reference of all the styles applied by Preflight, [see the stylesheet](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/main/packages/tailwindcss/preflight.css).

### Margins are removed

Preflight removes all of the default margins from all elements including headings, blockquotes, paragraphs, etc:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
*,
::after,
::before,
::backdrop,
::file-selector-button {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

This makes it harder to accidentally rely on margin values applied by the user-agent stylesheet that are not part of your spacing scale.

### Border styles are reset

In order to make it easy to add a border by simply adding the `border` class, Tailwind overrides the default border styles for all elements with the following rules:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
*,
::after,
::before,
::backdrop,
::file-selector-button {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border: 0 solid;
}
```

Since the `border` class only sets the `border-width` property, this reset ensures that adding that class always adds a solid `1px` border that uses `currentColor`.

This can cause some unexpected results when integrating certain third-party libraries, like [Google maps](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/484) for example.

When you run into situations like this, you can work around them by overriding the Preflight styles with your own custom CSS:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@layer base {
  .google-map * {
    border-style: none;
  }
}
```

### Headings are unstyled

All heading elements are completely unstyled by default, and have the same font size and weight as normal text:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
  font-size: inherit;
  font-weight: inherit;
}
```

The reason for this is two-fold:

- **It helps you avoid accidentally deviating from your type scale**. By default, browsers assign sizes to headings that don't exist in Tailwind's default type scale, and aren't guaranteed to exist in your own type scale.
- **In UI development, headings should often be visually de-emphasized**. Making headings unstyled by default means any styling you apply to headings happens consciously and deliberately.

You can always add default header styles to your project by [adding your own base styles](/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-base-styles).

### Lists are unstyled

Ordered and unordered lists are unstyled by default, with no bullets or numbers:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
ol,
ul,
menu {
  list-style: none;
}
```

If you'd like to style a list, you can do so using the [list-style-type](/docs/list-style-type) and [list-style-position](/docs/list-style-position) utilities:

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ul>
```

You can always add default list styles to your project by [adding your own base styles](/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-base-styles).

#### Accessibility considerations

Unstyled lists are [not announced as lists by VoiceOver](https://unfetteredthoughts.net/2017/09/26/voiceover-and-list-style-type-none/). If your content is truly a list but you would like to keep it unstyled, [add a "list" role](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/12/lists-and-safari.html) to the element:

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<ul role="list">
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ul>
```

### Images are block-level

Images and other replaced elements (like `svg`, `video`, `canvas`, and others) are `display: block` by default:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
img,
svg,
video,
canvas,
audio,
iframe,
embed,
object {
  display: block;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

This helps to avoid unexpected alignment issues that you often run into using the browser default of `display: inline`.

If you ever need to make one of these elements `inline` instead of `block`, simply use the `inline` utility:

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<img class="inline" src="..." alt="..." />
```

### Images are constrained

Images and videos are constrained to the parent width in a way that preserves their intrinsic aspect ratio:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
img,
video {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

This prevents them from overflowing their containers and makes them responsive by default. If you ever need to override this behavior, use the `max-w-none` utility:

```html
<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->
<img class="max-w-none" src="..." alt="..." />
```

#### Elements with a `hidden` attribute stay hidden

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
[hidden]:where(:not([hidden='until-found'])) {
  display: none !important;
}
```

This enforces that elements with a `hidden` attribute stay invisible unless using `hidden="until-found"`. Remove the `hidden` attribute if you want an element to be visible to the user.

## Extending Preflight

If you'd like to add your own base styles on top of Preflight, add them to the `base` CSS layer in your CSS using `@layer base`:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@layer base {
  h1 {
    font-size: var(--text-2xl);
  }
  h2 {
    font-size: var(--text-xl);
  }
  h3 {
    font-size: var(--text-lg);
  }
  a {
    color: var(--color-blue-600);
    text-decoration-line: underline;
  }
}
```

Learn more in the [adding base styles documentation](/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-base-styles).

## Disabling Preflight

If you'd like to completely disable Preflight—perhaps because you're integrating Tailwind into an existing project or you'd prefer to define your own base styles—you can do so by importing only the parts of Tailwind that you need.

By default, this is what `@import "tailwindcss";` injects:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

@import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme);
@import "tailwindcss/preflight.css" layer(base);
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities);
```

To disable Preflight, simply omit its import while keeping everything else:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

@import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme);
@import "tailwindcss/preflight.css" layer(base); /* [!code --] */
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities);
```

When importing Tailwind CSS' files individually, features like `source()`, `theme()`, and `prefix()` should go on their respective imports.

For example, source detection affects generated utilities, so `source(…)` should be added to the `utilities.css` import:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

@import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme);
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities); /* [!code --] */
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities) source(none); /* [!code ++] */
```

The same goes for `important`, which also affects utilities:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

@import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme);
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities); /* [!code --] */
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities) important; /* [!code ++] */
```

Similarly, `theme(static)` and `theme(inline)` affect the generated theme variables and should be placed on the `theme.css` import:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

@import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme); /* [!code --] */
@import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme) theme(static); /* [!code ++] */
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities);
```

Finally, using a prefix with `prefix(tw)` affects the utilities and variables, so it should go on both imports:

```css
/* [!code filename:CSS] */
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

@import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme); /* [!code --] */
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities); /* [!code --] */
@import "tailwindcss/theme.css" layer(theme) prefix(tw); /* [!code ++] */
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" layer(utilities) prefix(tw); /* [!code ++] */
```
