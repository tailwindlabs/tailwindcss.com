## Examples

### Basic example

Use font size utilities like `text-sm/6` and `text-lg/7` to set the font size and line-height of an element at the same time:

<Figure>

<Example>{
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-8">
    <div>
      <span className="mb-3 font-mono text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">text-sm/6</span>
      <p className="text-sm/6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
        So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
        my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship
        of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span className="mb-3 font-mono text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">text-sm/7</span>
      <p className="text-sm/7 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
        So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
        my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship
        of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span className="mb-3 font-mono text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">text-sm/8</span>
      <p className="text-sm/8 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
        So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
        my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship
        of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
      </p>
    </div>

  </div>
}</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:text-base/6,text-base/7,text-base/8] -->
<p class="text-base/6 ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="text-base/7 ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="text-base/8 ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

</Figure>

Each font size utility also sets a default line height when one isn't provided. You can learn more about these values and how to customize them in the [font-size documentation](/docs/font-size).

### Setting independently

Use `leading-<number>` utilities like `leading-6` and `leading-7` to set the line height of an element independent of the font-size:

<Figure>

<Example>
  {
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-8">
      <div>
        <span className="mb-3 font-mono text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">leading-6</span>
        <p className="leading-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
          So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
          my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
          kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span className="mb-3 font-mono text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">leading-7</span>
        <p className="leading-7 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
          So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
          my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
          kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span className="mb-3 font-mono text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">leading-8</span>
        <p className="leading-8 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
          So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
          my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
          kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:leading-6,leading-7,leading-8] -->
<p class="text-sm leading-6">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="text-sm leading-7">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="text-sm leading-8">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

</Figure>

### Removing the leading

Use the `leading-none` utility to set the line height of an element equal to its font size:

<Figure>

<Example>
  {
    <p className="mx-auto max-w-2xs text-2xl leading-none text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
      The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    </p>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:leading-none] -->
<p class="text-2xl leading-none ...">The quick brown fox...</p>
```

</Figure>

### Using a custom value

<UsingACustomValue element="p" utility="leading" name="line height" variable="line-height" value="1.5" />

### Responsive design

<ResponsiveDesign element="p" property="line-height" defaultClass="leading-5" featuredClass="leading-6" />

## Customizing your theme

<CustomizingYourSpacingScale utility="leading" />
