## Examples

### Wrapping normally

Use the `wrap-normal` utility to only allow line breaks at natural wrapping points, like spaces, hyphens, and punctuation:

<Figure>

<Example padding={false}>
  {
    <p className="mx-auto max-w-xs border-x border-x-pink-400/30 py-8 wrap-normal text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
      The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis,</span> a word that refers to a lung
      disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it
      is the same as silicosis.
    </p>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:wrap-normal] -->
<p class="wrap-normal">The longest word in any of the major...</p>
```

</Figure>

### Wrapping mid-word

Use the `wrap-break-word` utility to allow line breaks between letters in a word if needed:

<Figure>

<Example padding={false}>
  {
    <p className="mx-auto w-min max-w-xs border-x border-x-pink-400/30 py-8 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
      The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is{" "}
      <span className="font-bold wrap-break-word">pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis,</span> a word that
      refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a
      volcano; medically, it is the same as silicosis.
    </p>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:wrap-break-word] -->
<p class="w-min">
  The longest word... <span class="wrap-break-word">pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis,</span>
</p>
```

</Figure>

### Wrapping anywhere

The `wrap-anywhere` utility behaves similarly to `wrap-break-word`, except that the browser factors in mid-word line breaks when calculating the intrinsic `min-content` size of the element:

<Figure>

<Example padding={false} className="max-h-96">
  {
    <p className="mx-auto w-min max-w-xs border-x border-x-pink-400/30 py-8 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
      The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is{" "}
      <span className="font-bold wrap-anywhere">pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis,</span> a word that refers
      to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano;
      medically, it is the same as silicosis.
    </p>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:wrap-anywhere] -->
<p class="w-min">
  The longest word... <span class="wrap-anywhere">pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis,</span>
</p>
```

</Figure>

### Responsive design

<ResponsiveDesign element="p" property="overflow-wrap" defaultClass="wrap-normal" featuredClass="wrap-break-word" />
