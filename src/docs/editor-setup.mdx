## Syntax support

Tailwind CSS uses custom CSS syntax like `@theme`, `@variant`, and `@source`, and in some editors this can trigger warnings or errors where these rules aren't recognized.

If you're using VS Code, our official [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) plugin includes a dedicated Tailwind CSS language mode that has support for all of the custom at-rules and functions Tailwind uses.

In some cases, you may need to disable native CSS linting/validations if your editor is very strict about the syntax it expects in your CSS files.

## IntelliSense for VS Code

The official [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) extension for Visual Studio Code enhances the Tailwind development experience by providing users with advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

- **Autocomplete** — providing intelligent suggestions for utility classes, as well as [CSS functions and directives](/docs/functions-and-directives).
- **Linting** — highlighting errors and potential bugs in both your CSS and your markup.
- **Hover previews** — revealing the complete CSS for utility classes when you hover over them.
- **Syntax highlighting** — so that Tailwind features that use custom CSS syntax are highlighted correctly.

Check out the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/tailwindcss/intellisense) to learn more, or [add it to Visual Studio Code](vscode:extension/bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) to get started now.

## Class sorting with Prettier

We maintain an official [Prettier plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) for Tailwind CSS that automatically sorts your classes following our [recommended class order](/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted).

<img src={require("./img/prettier-banner.jpg").default.src} alt="" width={2400} height={819} className="rounded-lg" />

It works seamlessly with custom Tailwind configurations, and because it’s just a Prettier plugin, it works anywhere Prettier works—including every popular editor and IDE, and of course on the command line.

<!-- [!code filename:HTML] -->

<button class="text-white px-4 sm:px-8 py-2 sm:py-3 bg-sky-700 hover:bg-sky-800">Submit</button>

<!-- After -->
