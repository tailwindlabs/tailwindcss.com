## Examples

### Preventing parent overscrolling

Use the `overscroll-contain` utility to prevent scrolling in the target area from triggering scrolling in the parent element, but preserve "bounce" effects when scrolling past the end of the container in operating systems that support it:

<Figure hint="Scroll to see behavior">

<Example padding={false}>
  {
    <div className="h-48 space-y-4 overflow-auto overscroll-contain p-8 text-gray-600 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400">
      <p
        children={`
      Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the
      one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything
      to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.`}
      />
      <p
        children={`
      Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy,
      making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
      What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let
      me give you a hint, junior.`}
      />
      <p
        children={`
      Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure,
      we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down,
      opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding
      drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five
      Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?`}
      />
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:overscroll-contain] -->
<div class="overscroll-contain ...">Well, let me tell you something, ...</div>
```

</Figure>

### Preventing overscroll bouncing

Use the `overscroll-none` utility to prevent scrolling in the target area from triggering scrolling in the parent element, and also prevent "bounce" effects when scrolling past the end of the container:

<Figure hint="Scroll to see behavior">

<Example padding={false}>
  {
    <div className="h-48 space-y-4 overflow-auto overscroll-none p-8 text-gray-600 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400">
      <p
        children={`
      Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the
      one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything
      to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.`}
      />
      <p
        children={`
      Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy,
      making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
      What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let
      me give you a hint, junior.`}
      />
      <p
        children={`
      Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure,
      we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down,
      opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding
      drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five
      Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?`}
      />
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:overscroll-none] -->
<div class="overscroll-none ...">Well, let me tell you something, ...</div>
```

### Using the default overscroll behavior

Use the `overscroll-auto` utility to make it possible for the user to continue scrolling a parent scroll area when they reach the boundary of the primary scroll area:

<Figure hint="Scroll to see behavior">

<Example padding={false}>
  {
    <div className="h-48 space-y-4 overflow-auto overscroll-auto p-8 text-gray-600 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400">
      <p
        children={`
      Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the
      one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything
      to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.`}
      />
      <p
        children={`
      Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy,
      making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
      What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let
      me give you a hint, junior.`}
      />
      <p
        children={`
      Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure,
      we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down,
      opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding
      drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five
      Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?`}
      />
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:overscroll-auto] -->
<div class="overscroll-auto ...">Well, let me tell you something, ...</div>
```
